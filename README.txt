Welcome to Connor and Greg's COMP 8005 Project, The IP Port Forwarder, or IPPF as it is labelled in the accompanying programs.

How To Setup:
	- Modify the "IPP_Pairs.conf" located within the "Code" folder using the following structure:
		"EXTERNALIP:PORT-INTERNALIP:PORT,
		 EXTERNALIP1:PORT-INTERNALIP1:PORT,"

	- The above is an example of how to setup a list of IP and Port pairs, citing the external IP and port heading towards an internal IP and port.

	- 

How to Use:
	- Run the "IPPF.sh" in the same folder as the IPP_Pairs.conf file. This will run the port forwarder program and redirect the indicated traffic.

Notes and Troubleshooting:
	- Tip #1
	- TIp #2
